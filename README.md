# Intro-to-Deep-Learning
   This repository contains some important topics for deep networks such as:
1. Architecture of networks, different layers with their functionalities, CNN for images and text, RNN for text generations andtaging
2. Challenges of training deep networks such as ill_conditioned data, vanishing/exploding gradient and how to deal with them
3. Implement simple layers only with numpy (without keras API etc.) and feature them with regularizer, dropout etc.
4. Build CNN for image classification. 
5. Fine tune heavy pretrained model (with over 22 million params) to adapt it for the task in hand such as classification. 
6. Several amazing uses of Autoencoders for images such as dimensionality reduction, image search, denoising, greating new images ects.
7.
